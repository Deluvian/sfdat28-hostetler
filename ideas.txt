Capstone Project Ideas:


1.Twitch content tagging algorithm, where we take in data from various sources and classify content as it goes live.
	-Probably value low variance over bias for this model
	-Use NLP on the steam titles
	-Scrape game wikis to understand the team's/players
		Tags:
		Professionals
		Semi-Professionals
		Former-Professionals
		Caster
		E-Sports Content
		Community Content

2. Machine learning on video recognition  (Tag which game is being played based on video recognition)
	-Figure out at which point in the video the broadcaster changes games

3. Machine learning on chat (programmatically clip/highlights good parts of videos)
	-NLP to suggest titles
	-Use chat velocity to understand what parts of the video need to be clipped
	
4. Learn how to evaluate social media buzz of advertising campaigns
	-Use NLP across social media (facebook, twitter) to understand if ad buying is changing the sentiment around brand/advertiser
